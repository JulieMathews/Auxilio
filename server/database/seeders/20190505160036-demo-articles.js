let article1 = `<p>As children, we learn who we are and how we are valued by the feedback we
receive from other people. If we do something and others respond with warmth, admiration, and
pleasure, we think of that action as reflecting the good part of ourselves. If, on the other
hand, we do something and it is met with disapproval or withdrawal of love, we have been bad
and we must not do it again.</p>

<P>How Kids with ADHD Are Perceived and Judged</p>

<p>There are three basic ways in which this feedback loop goes wrong for children with attention
deficit disorder. The first is that kids with ADHD rarely behave the same way consistently enough
to get a consistent stream of feedback. Sometimes they are empathic and other times self-absorbed.
If they find something interesting, they can achieve anything but they cannot do 20 minutes of
homework without a meltdown. It can be hard to develop a singular sense of self while evoking
contradictory feedback.</p>

let article2 = `<p>One lesser known curse of attention deficit disorder (ADHD or ADD) is low self-esteem.</p>
<p>In my more than 20 years of mental health training and practice, I have yet to meet a child diagnosed with ADHD who doesn’t feel bad about him or herself from time to time. In addition to attention and concentration issues, children with ADHD struggle with an underlying belief that they are broken — that something’s wrong with them and they cannot control it.</p>
<p>In the very moments when they are trying to do their best, their bodies betray them. The world reprimands them for being “a little too much.” And they are externally stigmatized and internally shamed with the notion that, even if they want to be good — they can’t.</p>
<p>Parents whose children have ADHD know the scenario all too well: Your child gets overly excited at an inopportune moment. You see him try to control himself, but he can’t. You or someone else tells him to calm down or stop. Your child does the exact opposite. Your patience diminishes and your frustration increases; maybe you scold him more harshly than you mean to or maybe he feels the shame coming and act out even more.</p>
<p>In the end, your child feels worse about himself. It’s heartbreaking for parents and providers who know deep down that these kids are good kids trying every day to do their best.</p>`

let article3 = `<h5> My work with brave, resilient, and astute children has taught me that children with ADHD can stop the cycle. Here are a few simple and fun mind-body awareness exercises that kids can do to begin to do to take back control:</h5>
<ol>
<li> Deep breathing. Taking a big, deep belly breath teaches kids that they can stop themselves and regroup. And, even better, they often feel calmer afterwards.</li>
<li> Progressive muscle relaxation. Children can learn body control and gain another tool for self-calming by practicing tightening and relaxing different muscle groups. In my own daily life, I have found that I can stop myself from saying or doing something I may otherwise regret by shrugging my shoulders in an exaggerated way and then dropping them back down.</li>
<li> Taking your pulse and regulating it. Because heart rate is often linked to emotions, some kids find it useful to take their pulse when they feel excited, nervous, or angry as an indicator of their mind-body state. Gaining control of heart rate can be a wonderful proxy for developing emotional regulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is tremendously liberating when kids realize that they can stop the cycle of low self-esteem by controlling some part of their body. In fact, I distinctly remember the day when a patient of mine realized his own power of self-control. He was the youngest of four very successful over-achieving brothers. He was bright, articulate, sensitive, and reactive. He would often have an outburst in school settings surrounding math (a challenging subject for him). Then, he would feel terrible and act out even more because he couldn’t control his feelings of shame around his initial over-reaction.</p>
<p>All who knew him struggled to watch him in this cycle. After three days of mind-body work he came running into my office: “Erina, Erina, guess what I just realized! These games — they taught me that I CAN control myself. I don’t HAVE to be a bad kid. I can fix myself.”</p>
<p>Healthcare practitioners tend to look at ADHD as a deficit that needs to be fixed through medication or long-term therapy. What gets lost is the emotional burden that children with ADHD take on. Because they feel responsible for their behavior and the disruptions it can cause, they’re desperate for tools to self-regulate. Mind-body awareness is one of those tools, and it can be incredibly freeing and empowering for children who learn how to use it.</p>`

let article4 = `<p>When my alarm sounds, I’ve learned to hit the floor quickly, brush my teeth, wash my face, and throw on the Mom uniform: yoga pants and a tee. Through trial and error, I’ve mastered completing this all-hands-on-deck routine before my 6 year old, who has ADHD and sensory processing disorder, wakes up.
Am I the only one who feels like she’s run a marathon before 8 a.m.?<br>
Even though we picked out Kennedy’s pale pink sparkly unicorn tunic and leggings last night as the day’s selected outfit, I am fully prepared for the texture of the shirt or socks to bug her when she slides them on. There is a 50/50 chance she will refuse to wear them. And I’ve learned not to sweat it.
I know that no matter how gently I comb through her beautiful, chestnut-brown curly locks, she’s going to yell at me and argue that I can’t put a cute little grosgrain ribbon bow in her hair like her friends wear.
“Leave it down, Mom,” she might say with irritation. “I like my hair natural and wild.”<br>
But the biggest stressor of all? When I get out her morning Vyvanse pill.<br>
“Do you want to take it in chocolate milk this morning, or a muffin?” I ask, afraid of the response.<br>
“Neither,” Kennedy says.<br>
After putting up a half-hearted fight, Kennedy obliges and takes her medicine in a scoop of chocolate ice cream. Chocolate ice cream? Don’t judge. Sometimes you just have to keep the peace.<br>
After getting her backpack and coat, and strapping herself into her car seat, Kennedy says, “Mommy, I love you! I’ll miss you and sissy today.”<br>
And just like that my heart melts.<br>
<p>My sweet girl doesn’t mean to struggle in the mornings. She simply likes things a certain way, and morning routines are hard on everyone — including her.
I’ve learned what to expect and I try to keep our morning routine as simple as possible. Like most kids with ADHD, Kennedy is thrown off by any slight deviation. On this particular day, I drop off Kennedy at kindergarten, knowing she loves me and knowing we made it through another school morning with few battle wounds.
It’s almost spring break in Charlotte, which means the school year is nearing an end.</p>
Summer in our home is a lot more lax as nobody feels the pressure to rush out the door quickly, and we can go at Kennedy’s pace even though we still try to keep a routine. I’m looking forward to a summer full of sunshine, parks, and playdates — and a break from the stressful school morning routine.`

let article5 = `<p>Before entering parenthood, you never imagined that someone you loved would affix 23 Pokémon stickers inside your rear car windows. Or pour shampoo in the washing machine “just to see.” Or scream directly in your face over taking out the recycling. But here you are — facing the reality that parenting a child with attention deficit disorder (ADHD or ADD) is a daily (if not hourly) test of your patience.</p>
<p>Few would blame you for yelling out “I’ve had it!” Your frustration, anger, and exhaustion are understandable. But that doesn’t mean they are healthy — to either you or your child.</p>
<p>To see real change and growth in your child’s behavior, you’ve got to make a fundamental shift from reactive (“I’ve had it!") to proactive parenting. What does this look like? Proactive parents do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Speak with intention and consistency
<li> Create plans and follow routines
<li> Reward direction over outcome
<li>Accept and learn from mistakes — their own and their child’s
</ul>
<p>How Reactive Parenting Sucks Us In</p>
<ul>
<li>“She’s trying to drive me crazy.”</li>
<li>“How many times do I have to tell him?”</li>
<li>“Why is he doing this to me?”</li>
</ul>`

let article6 =`<p>Our son received his first diagnosis three summers ago. Since then, four more have joined his laundry list of what teachers and therapists call “special needs.” Our rambunctious little ball of energy began showing signs that his Dad and I, with a combined 20-plus years of experience educating and caring for the special-needs population, knew were red flags.</p>
<p>He is almost seven years old now, but we spent the better part of his life from age two to five pleading with specialists and doctors who refused to evaluate a child that young. They doubted, but we already knew.</p>
<p>Our days were filled with unarticulated emotions, explosions of frustration, radically aggressive meltdowns, and even restraint as we tried to prevent self-harm or harm to others. This was more than parenting a defiant toddler or adolescent; we were exhausted each day by repeating over and over again, “No,” “Don’t do that,” “Get down from there,” and “Please stop. That is dangerous.”</p>
<p>We saw therapists, specialists, OTs, play and talk therapists, and natural remedy healers. We finally decided to medicate our son. But what we learned along the way was that he was hearing lots more negative talk than positive reinforcement or praise from us, his parents — the two people who should be his greatest cheerleaders.</p>
<p>This revelation was no surprise to us. We’d felt the weight of our corrections for years, and we felt unable to redirect our son’s behaviors, teach him discipline, and keep him safe while balancing the parental desire to lift him up and make sure he knew we believed he could do anything.</p>
<p>Last August, after more than a year of research supporting the idea of simplification and minimalism as a means to address sensory overload for children with needs similar to our son’s, our family sold our 15-acre farm, gave away at least 80 percent of our belongings, and moved into a 36-foot gooseneck tiny home. The drastic reduction in clothes, décor, toys, and stuff has, in the last year, had a positive impact on our son’s ability to manage his surroundings and to thrive in his daily environment.</p>`

let article7 =`<h6>To my son’s doctors:</h6>
<p>Before I even thought about you, I watched my son struggle to find the shoes sitting right in front of him. I wondered why he gave me a blank stare when I told him to do this and then that. I spent hours trying to get him to complete his homework — and years feeling annoyed at the fight because the work usually took just 5 minutes to complete. I watched him at the playground, playing all alone. Then received the harsh stares and words of parent who heard profanities come out of his mouth. I watched the simplest tasks become the biggest fights. And listened as my son told me “It’s just too hard — everything is impossible.” I wondered what was wrong with him.</p>
<p>Before I met you, I wracked my brain thinking of ways to help him. I also answered untold calls from the school. While trying to layer in good things about my son, they always ended up emphasizing the many things he did wrong — despite their efforts. And I worried — a lot.</p>
<p>Before we met, my mother told me I needed to create more structure. My aunt told me I needed to be present. Others told me that I had it all figured out. When I tried to make changes, the very people offering advice then quickly undermined me.</p>
<p>I cried. I checked out. I yelled. I screamed. I hit. I blamed others. I questioned myself. I resented my son.</p>
<p>Then, at some point, summoned the strength to dig deep. I made a plan. And it led me to you.</p>`

let article9 = `<p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today.</p>
<p>We know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently.</p>
<p>Several factors may influence the development of autism, and it is often accompanied by sensory sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures or sleep disorders, as well as mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues.</p>
<p>Indicators of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that early intervention leads to positive outcomes later in life for people with autism.</p>
